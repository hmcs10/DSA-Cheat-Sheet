# Basic terminologies ->

1. **Graph**: A representation of connections between nodes or vertices. Types include undirected (no specific direction) and directed (with specific direction) graphs.

2. **Node/Vertex**: Represented by circles, these are the entities in a graph.

3. **Edge**: The connection between nodes. Can be undirected (bi-directional) or directed (one-way).

4. **Undirected Graph**: A graph where edges have no specific direction.

5. **Directed Graph**: A graph with edges having a specific direction.

6. **Cycle**: A path that starts and ends at the same node, leading to terms like undirected cyclic graph and directed cyclic graph.

7. **Path**: A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.

8. **Degree**: In undirected graphs, it's the number of edges connected to a node. The total degree is twice the number of edges. In directed graphs, it's split into in-degree (incoming edges) and out-degree (outgoing edges).

9. **Edge Weight**: A numerical value assigned to edges, influencing the properties of the graph. If not specified, unit weight (1) is assumed.
